# Accessibility Contributions Setup

This guide helps you set up the accessibility contributions feature that allows MapMission participants to add photos, reviews, and ratings about accessibility features.

## Overview

The accessibility contributions system includes:
- **Photos**: Users can upload photos of accessibility features (ramps, elevators, parking, etc.)
- **Reviews**: Users can write detailed reviews about accessibility features with difficulty ratings
- **Ratings**: Users can rate accessibility features on availability, condition, and overall accessibility

## Database Setup

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `src/lib/setup_accessibility_tables.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

### Option 2: Using Command Line

1. Set your environment variables:
```bash
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup_accessibility_db.sh
```

- Form validation errors

## Technical Requirements

- React Native 0.81.4+
- Expo SDK 54+
- Supabase client
- expo-image-picker for photo functionality
- Proper Supabase storage bucket configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Tables Error (PGRST205)
If you see database errors about missing tables, run the SQL setup script in your Supabase dashboard.

### Photo Upload Issues
Ensure your Supabase storage bucket is properly configured with appropriate policies for authenticated users.

### Import Path Errors
The system uses relative imports. If you see import errors, check that file paths match your project structure.

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.js                    # Database service methods
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ setup_accessibility_tables.sql # Database schema
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AccessibilityContributionScreen.js # Main contribution interface

â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ MapMissionSetupModal.js        # Mission setup modal

## Next Steps
